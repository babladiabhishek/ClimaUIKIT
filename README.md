Weather App
Project Overview
In this project, I created a weather app that displays the current weather condition for a user's current location or a location they manually search for. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve live weather data, and the user interface is designed to support dark mode.

Technologies Used
Swift
Xcode
OpenWeatherMap API
Core Location framework
Features
Dark mode support
Get current location weather data
Search for weather data in a specific location
Display weather data including temperature, condition, and location
Condition-specific weather icons
Error handling for invalid user input or network issues
How to Use
To use the app, simply open it on your iPhone and grant location access. The app will display the current weather for your location. To search for weather in a specific location, tap the search bar at the top of the screen and enter a city name or zip code. The app will display the weather for that location if it is valid.
